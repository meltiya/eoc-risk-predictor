EOC Risk Predictor Made in Java

This simple program predicts whether a student is likely to pass an end-of-course (EOC) assessment based on baseline score and current class average (4.0 scale).

Logic
- Baseline ≥ 50 and GPA ≥ 2.5 → Likely to Pass
- Baseline < 50 and GPA < 2.5 → At Risk
- Otherwise → Borderline

Why I built this
- Practice with Java OOP concepts: constructors, encapsulation, private helpers, and decision logic.
- To estimate EOC readiness for my students in a simple way.
